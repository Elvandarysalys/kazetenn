#Kazetenn

#What is Kaztenn ?
Kazetenn is a Symfony 5 bundle that aims to provide a quick CMS functionality while still getting symfony's power.

#Why ?
- I don't like WordPress and Drupal
- It is a fun pet project to have

#How to use it ?
Create a symfony project (full or skeleton, it doesn't matter) and use : 

````shell
composer require elvandar/kazetenn
````

#What does it do ?
